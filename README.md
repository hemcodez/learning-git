# learning-git
## Hihi 👋🏽, welcome to my first GitHub repository!

**Here, I am honing my Git skills as a developer using this video tutorial as my guide. The video titled "Complete Git and Github Hands On Tutorial with Commands" (available at https://youtu.be/_kwJ2GCafuA) has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of Git's fundamentals. Alongside this invaluable resource, I'm also utilizing an interactive platform called Learn Git Branching (accessible at https://learngitbranching.js.org/) to further reinforce my knowledge. By combining these two sources and a load of documentation, I am excited to expand my proficiency in Git, enhancing my ability to collaborate, version control, and manage projects efficiently.**
